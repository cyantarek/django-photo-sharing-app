# Django Photo Sharing App

Hello, I've created this app for a job interview. It took 8+ hours to build this app from scratch upto deployment.

I used this tehnologies:

01. Python Django
02. Bootstrap

I've commented most of the classes and functions so it is easier to understand.

I've deployed it in heroku: https://foto-sharing.herokuapp.com/
Passwords:
For "My Album" - 123456

Thanks.
